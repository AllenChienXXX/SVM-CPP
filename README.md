# **Support-Vector-Machine**
# Introduction
Support vector machine was based on optimizing linear classification which one of them was known as logistic regression. By adding the margins to expand the area, it alows more accurate and precise prediction than linear regression or logistic regression.

This project will not focus on support vector machine algorithms but instead focusing on using Sequential minimal optimization(SMO) to solve the dual problem.
